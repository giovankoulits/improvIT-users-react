Method:
I tried to keep things simple and clear.
I used raw CSS due to the simplicity of the design.
I did not find it necessary to install a CSS framework or preprocessor.
I chose React instead of raw JS for modularity and shorter syntax.
I Installed react-spinners for the loading animation.

Installation:
Navigate to the project in the console and run the command <npm install>.

Deployment:
Run the command <npm run dev>.
The project will be live on localhost on the specified port within the console message. The default address is: http://localhost:5173.
