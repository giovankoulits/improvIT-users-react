**Method:**<br>
I tried to keep things simple and clear.<br>  
I used raw CSS due to the simplicity of the design.<br>  
I did not find it necessary to install a CSS framework or preprocessor.<br>
I chose React instead of raw JS for modularity and shorter syntax.<br>
I Installed react-spinners for the loading animation.<br>

**Installation:**<br>
Navigate to the project in the console and run the command <npm install>.<br>

**Deployment:**<br>
Run the command <npm run dev>.<br>
The project will be live on localhost on the specified port within the console message. The default address is: http://localhost:5173.<br>
